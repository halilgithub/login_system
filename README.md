# login_system
I developed a sample **Login System** with PyQt5 library and Python.
Everything is kept in txt files, no database is used.
I will it improve it and add new features in the near future.

## features

Basically, as admin you can login and do some stuff:
  + see user list with their profil data and last-seen time
  + add user
  + update/delete user

You can also login as normal user and take these actions:
  + see your last-seen date and time
  + change your password

## usage

Execute the program from command line:

```console
foo@bar:~$ python main.py
```
