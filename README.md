# login_system
A sample **Login System** developed with PyQt5 library and Python.
Everything is kept in txt files, no database is used.
I will it improve it and add new features in the near futures.

## features

Basically, as admin you can login and do some stuff:
  + see user list with their profil data and last-seen time
  + add user
  + update/delete user
  
You can also login as normal user and take these actions:
  + see your last-seen date and time
  + change your password
